# CODE BOOK

This document describes the dataset generated for the Coursera Training - Getting and Cleaning Data Project. 

## DISCLAIMER
This dataset is a based on the dataset produced and described from the following publication
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

## INTRODUCTION 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (`WALKING`, `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`, `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`, `SITTING`, `STANDING`, `LAYING`) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

## FEATURES

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAccXYZ and tGyroXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAccXYZ and tGravityAccXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAccXYZ, fBodyAccJerkXYZ, fBodyGyroXYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* tBodyAccXYZ
* tGravityAccXYZ
* tBodyAccJerkXYZ
* tBodyGyroXYZ
* tBodyGyroJerkXYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAccXYZ
* fBodyAccJerkXYZ
* fBodyGyroXYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* mean: Mean value
* std: Standard deviation

## TIDY DATASET

For each record it is provided a 68-feature vector with:

- Subject identifier (from 1 to 30) who carried out the experiment.
- Activity label ()
- Average value of the variables described in the [FEATURES][]

## NOTES

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## CONCLUSION

The [tidy_dataset.csv](tidy_dataset.csv) is the dataset for which this code book refers to.
